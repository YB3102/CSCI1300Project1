* This function accepts two strings and then according to the parameters, compares the first string to the second string(golden sequence.)
Both strings must be of same length. The function then returns a likeness score as per the given criteria in the question.
* Parameters: string seq1, string seq2 - the strings passed into the function. seq2 is the golden sequence to which the first string is compared to.
* Return: double likeness_score : the double likness score obtained after comparing the string as per the given criteria.
